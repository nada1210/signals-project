## Project Overview

Stress is a significant factor affecting both mental and physical health. With advancements in wearable technology, continuous and non-invasive stress monitoring is now achievable.

This project leverages the **WESAD** dataset, focusing specifically on **wrist-worn sensor data**, to build a robust **machine learning model** capable of detecting stress states in individuals.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Program Flow

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Load all essential Python libraries for data processing, feature extraction, and machine learning.

2. **Dataset Setup**  
   Define paths and parameters for accessing the WESAD dataset (wrist subset).

3. **Data Processing**  
   - Load raw data  
   - Clean and preprocess signals  
   - Segment and normalize

4. **Feature Extraction**  
   Extract meaningful statistical and signal-based features from the sensor readings.

5. **Train-Test Split**  
   Split data into training and testing sets for model validation.

6. **Model Training**  
   Train a machine learning model to classify stress vs. non-stress states.

7. **Evaluation**  
   Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
